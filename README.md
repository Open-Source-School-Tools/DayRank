# DayRank
DayRank is a useful tool to assess how a students day went. All you do is put the students name, rank every period based on how bad/good it was, and boom! Your final result. Made with Qt, it is easy to use and produces 100% acurrate results!

**NOTE: SOME RESULTS ARE NOT ACCURATE. THIS MAY BE IMPROVED IN A FUTURE UPDATE.**

**NOTE: THIS TOOL WAS MADE FOR MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOLS. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WILL BE SUPPORTED IN A FUTURE UPDATE.**
